# Sink Oar Swim

A white river kayaking game where players can speed through the river, dodge the rocks, and catch bubbles to increase their score. River flow gets faster periodically. Players have three lives and they lose one everytime they crash against a rock. They can get more lives by catching the red crosses, and the value of the bubbles increase as the speed of the river increases. The goal of this project is to create a fun game for users and to make them want to improve their personal scores.

### Functionality & MVPs

In Sink Oar Swim, players will be able to:

- Start, pause (by pressing the letter 'space-bar' key), and reset the game
- Increase their scores by grabbing bubbles
- Increase their lives by catching the red crosses
- Move character either to the left (by pressing the left arrow key) or to the right (by pressing the right arrow key)

In addition, this project will include:

- A home page and a 'how to play' page describing the background and rules of the game
- A production README
- Sound effects
- Optional music playing in the background
- Score tracking

## Implementation Timeline

- This is how I had initially planned to build the game:

- Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Create sprite sheet with all images that I will use in the game. Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Create classes and see game objects and sprites rendered on screen.

- Monday: Work on game logic. Code collision detection.

- Tuesday: If main logic is completed, I will start working on sprite animations.

- Wednesday: If sprite animations are done, work on styling on UI styling of page and modal. Add background music and game pause functionality.

- Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
