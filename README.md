# Sink Oar Swim

A white river kayaking game where users speed through a river and the longer they last without crashing, the higher their scores are. Users increase their scores through a combination of how long they last without crashing and how much currency they collect (in the form of bubbles). As time passes, speed of river will increase and more rocks might appear on the path, increasing the level of difficulty of the game. The goal of this project is to create a fun game for users and to make them want to improve their personal scores.

### Functionality & MVPs

In Sink Oar Swim, users will be able to:

- Start, pause (by pressing the letter p key), and reset the game
- Increase their scores by grabbing bubbles and by lasting withouth hitting rocks
- Catch “power ups” to increase their chances of lasting longer. Ocationally, some turtle shells will appear on the water, and when users catch them, they aquire inmunity against rocks for a period of time
- Use only two keys, one to move to the left, and another to move to the right

In addition, this project will include:

- An about/home page describing the background and rules of the game
- A production README
- Music playing in the background
- Score tracking system using localStorage

## Implementation Timeline

- Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Create sprite sheet with all images that I will use in the game. Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Create classes and see game objects and sprites rendered on screen.

- Monday: Work on game logic. Code collision detection.

- Tuesday: If main logic is completed, I will start working on sprite animations.

- Wednesday: If sprite animations are done, work on styling on UI styling of page and modal. Add background music and game pause functionality.

- Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
